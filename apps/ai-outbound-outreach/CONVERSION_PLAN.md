# SendSpark Completion Plan (Incomplete → Full Standalone App)

## Superpowers Systematic Workflow

### Phase 1: Design - Current State Analysis

**Framework:** React + Vite (partially installed)  
**Type:** Workflow automation + social/email publishing  
**Source:** Features in deangilmoredemix/remix-new-editor  
**Current State:** Directory exists with node_modules, backend/, but no source code in Open-Higgsfield-AI

#### What Exists:
- ✅ `apps/ai-outbound-outreach/` directory structure
- ✅ Backend folder with uploads/ (Python? Node?)
- ✅ Vite config (multiple timestamped versions)
- ✅ Some logs (ai-vfx.log, ai-outbound-outreach.log)
- ✅ `src/components/SendsparkWorkflow.jsx` in main app (reference UI)
- ✅ Documentation in remix-new-editor: `SENDSPARK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ Actual frontend source code (no src/ directory)
- ❌ package.json for ai-outbound-outreach app
- ❌ Complete implementation

#### Source Repository Analysis:

From `deangilmoredemix/remix-new-editor`:
- **SENDSPARK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - complete feature spec
- **ai-outbound-outreach-research-analysis.md** - research documentation
- **ai-outbound-outreach-style-video-creation.md** - style guide
- Likely has full implementation in `apps/ai-outbound-outreach/` subdirectory

### Phase 2: Plan - Build Complete App

**Strategy:** Extract complete SendSpark implementation from remix-new-editor repository and make it standalone.

#### Task 1: Clone Source Repository (5 min)
```bash
cd apps
git clone https://github.com/deangilmoredemix/remix-new-editor.git ai-outbound-outreach-source
# Extract apps/ai-outbound-outreach/ from this repo
```

#### Task 2: Copy Complete Implementation (10 min)
- Copy `apps/ai-outbound-outreach/` from remix-new-editor to Open-Higgsfield-AI
- Ensure all files present: src/, package.json, vite.config.js, etc.
- Preserve original structure

#### Task 3: Adapt for Main App (15 min)
- Update API endpoints to main app's backend
- Integrate with existing Supabase if used
- Connect to main app's auth system
- Update routing in main router

#### Task 4: Test Integration (10 min)
- Run dev server
- Test all workflow features
- Verify email/social publishing
- Check backend connectivity

**Total Estimated Time:** 40 minutes (mostly copying)

### Phase 3: TDD - Test Plan

#### Tests Needed (from source):
- Workflow creation/editing
- Publishing integrations (email, social)
- Video processing pipeline
- Backend API connectivity
- Authentication/authorization

#### Add Tests If Missing:
If source lacks tests, create minimal coverage:
- Workflow CRUD operations
- Publishing triggers
- Status tracking

### Phase 4: Execute - Implementation Steps

**Step 1:** Clone remix-new-editor to extract ai-outbound-outreach
**Step 2:** Copy complete `apps/ai-outbound-outreach/` directory
**Step 3:** Update dependencies to match main app
**Step 4:** Configure Vite for standalone mode
**Step 5:** Add route to main router: `/ai-outbound-outreach`
**Step 6:** Test end-to-end workflow

### Phase 5: Review - Quality Gates

- [ ] All source files copied from remix-new-editor
- [ ] npm install completes successfully
- [ ] Vite dev server runs
- [ ] Workflows accessible via main app
- [ ] Email publishing functional
- [ ] Social media publishing functional
- [ ] Backend integration working
- [ ] No console errors

### Alternative: Build from Scratch (if source incomplete)

If source repo doesn't have complete SendSpark:

#### Minimal Viable Product:
1. **Workflow Builder UI** (from existing SendsparkWorkflow.jsx)
2. **Backend Service** (likely Python in backend/ folder)
3. **Publishing Integrations**:
   - Email (SMTP/SendGrid)
   - Social media APIs (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
4. **Video Processing** (FFmpeg, cloud services)

#### Components to Build:
- Workflow configuration UI
- Step-based pipeline editor
- Integration connector UI
- Execution monitoring dashboard
- Results/reporting view

## Status: Source Extraction Required  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (depends on other apps)  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours (if source exists) or 8-12 hours (if building)  
**Confidence:** 90% (assuming complete source in remix-new-editor)
